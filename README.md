# QueryDoc - Intelligent Document Query System

## 📌 Project Description
QueryDoc is an AI-powered platform that processes natural language queries and retrieves relevant clauses from large unstructured documents such as policies, contracts, and emails. It applies domain-specific rules to return decisions with clause-level justifications in a structured, usable format.
